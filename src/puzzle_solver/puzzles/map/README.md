# Map (Puzzle Type #18)

This is a dedicated solver for Map.

Below are the details of how to utilize the solver. In addition, the solver gives all possible solutions to the input thus it can be utilized to figure out if a single partial input board has multiple possible solutions.

(The solver under the hood mainly utilizes the CP-SAT solver from Google OR-Tools)

* [**Instructions**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/doc/map.html#map)

You are given a map consisting of a number of regions. Your task is to colour each region with one of four colours, in such a way that no two regions sharing a boundary have the same colour. You are provided with some regions already coloured, sufficient to make the remainder of the solution unique, and these cannot be changed.

Only regions which share a length of border are required to be different colours. Two regions which meet at only one point (i.e. are diagonally separated) may be the same colour.
