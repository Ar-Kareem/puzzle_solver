# Flip (Puzzle Type #44)

This is a dedicated solver for Flip.

Below are the details of how to utilize the solver. In addition, the solver gives all possible solutions to the input thus it can be utilized to figure out if a single partial input board has multiple possible solutions.

(The solver under the hood mainly utilizes the CP-SAT solver from Google OR-Tools)

* [**Instructions**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/doc/flip.html#flip)

You have a grid of squares, some light and some dark. Your aim is to light all the squares up at the same time. You can choose any square and flip its state from light to dark or dark to light, but when you do so, other squares around it change state as well.

Code to utilize this package and solve the puzzle:

(Note: the solver also supports random mapping of squares to the neighbors they flip, see the test cases in `tests/test_flip.py` for usage examples)

```python
import numpy as np
from puzzle_solver import flip_solver as solver
board = np.array([
    ['B', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W'],
    ['B', 'B', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'B', 'B'],
    ['W', 'B', 'W', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],
    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'W', 'B', 'W'],
    ['W', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W'],
    ['B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'W', 'W'],
    ['B', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'W', 'B', 'B'],
])
binst = solver.Board(board=board)
solutions = binst.solve_and_print()
```

**Script Output**

The output tells you which squares to tap to solve the puzzle, the shaded squares are the ones that need to be tapped.
