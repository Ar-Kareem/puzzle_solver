Most of the puzzles we target in this repo are pen and paper puzzles (i.e. not dynamic puzzles). The simplest and biggest difference is that if the puzzle can be played on a printed sheet of paper then it is not a dynamic puzzle. 

The only exception to the above rule is "Pipes" which might not easilly work on a printed sheet of paper as the icons need to be rotated but I still consider it to be significantly on the pen and paper side of the spectrum.

We rarely provide solvers for dynamic puzzles except for (at the time of writing) five puzzles which are Minesweeper, Guess, Inertia, Flood it, and Twiddle.

Below we list the puzzles that are yet to be implemented in the websites listed above.

## Website 1 ✅

**https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles (All puzzles are playable)**

All pen and paper puzzles have been implemented. 

A total of 33 puzzles were implemented, and 7 remaining puzzles we aren't targeting which are all dynamic.

## Website 2 ✅

**https://www.puzzle-kurodoko.com/ (All puzzles are playable)**

All pen and paper logic puzzles have been implemented.

39 puzzles were implemented, and only 1 remaining puzzle we aren't targeting which is a word search puzzle. We are interested in logic games that depend on pure mathematical reasoning and not simply dependent on a specific language.

## Website 3 (In Progress)

**https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/ (Does not have playable puzzles, only instructions)**

Only 15 out of 45 puzzles are implemented.

There are still several puzzles in here that we plan on implementing in the future. As this website does not host playable version of the puzzles, we will slightly deprioritize them unless the puzzles are hosted somewhere else online in another website.

## Website 4 ✅

**https://www.brainbashers.com/puzzles.asp (All puzzles are playable; Website up since 1997)**

All pen and paper puzzles have been implemented.

21 puzzles were implemented, and only 1 remaining puzzle we aren't targeting which is a dynamic puzzle (Net Slide also on website 1).

## Website 5 (In Progress)

**https://krazydad.com (Some puzzles are playable, some are only printable)**

The website has exactly 86 puzzles in total:

- 54 are Sudoku-like puzzles (?/54 implemented)
- 22 Interactive and nonudoku puzzles (16/22 implemented; 6 remaining)
- 10 Printable only non-Sudoku puzzles (4/10 implemented; 6 remaining)

Sudoku variants are so abundant so they are currently not prioritized.

## Website 6 (Not Started)

**https://puzzlemadness.co.uk/ (All puzzles are playable)**

We have yet to thoroughly go through the puzzles on this website.
